 <h2 class ="res9"> Ocean Blue at the Beach </h2>


<p class= "res0">  Above is the balmy beautiful sky’s hue </br>
Presenting an exquisite cerulean blue </br>
Gems are compared to this colour in sight </br>
As their beauty is like the lights of the night</br> </br> 

I smell the salt of the deep ocean </br>
Experiencing a rather forgotten emotion </br>
The fragrance sweetened by the ocean’s bellowing breath </br>
Like the winds gentle whisper amidst the season’s breadth </br> </br> 

And the strength of the roar of the waves that sing </br>
I lay floating about to what they bring </br>
But in hazy slumber I am overcome </br>
By the taste of the saltwater that submerges some </br> </br> 

Raising myself I fight for air </br>
Reminding myself to be more aware </br>
Thankfully watching the currents sway </br>
Looking at the sun to confirm the time of day </br> </br> 

In its calmness the water brings joy to my heart </br>
In its close presence and at a distance apart </br>
And soon comes the crested golden sun </br>
Conveying that the day is done </br> </br> 

Alas, I await the night to fall </br>
Hearing the sounds of the owl’s brawl </br>
The ebony sky is decorated by the stars above </br>
And with this day and night I fall in love </p>
